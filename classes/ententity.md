# entEntity

## Description

An `Entity` is essentially a "thing" in the game world. This can be a player character, NPC, vehicle, or an object like a weapon or a door. Each entity has specific attributes, like health, position, and abilities, that define how it behaves and interacts with the environment.

### **Basic components of an Entity:**

* **Components:** These are smaller parts that make up an entity, such as physics, animations, and behaviors. Components are what give an entity its abilities, like moving, interacting, or taking damage.
* **Properties:** These are data fields that define things like health, speed, size, or position in the world.
* **Events:** Entities can send and receive events to trigger actions. For instance, an NPC can trigger an event when it detects the player.
