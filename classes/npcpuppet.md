# NPCPuppet

## Description

Represents non-player characters (NPCs) in the game.

These are the characters that the player interacts with but doesn’t directly control, such as enemies, civilians, vendors, and allies.

* AI Behaviors: contains the logic for how NPCs think and act. This includes things like combat AI (how an enemy attacks, seeks cover, or flees), daily routines (what civilians do during the day), and response behaviors (like reacting to gunfire or the player’s presence).
* Factions: NPCs can belong to factions (e.g., gangs or corporate groups), and this affects how they interact with other factions and the player. You can adjust faction relationships, which influences whether NPCs are hostile, friendly, or neutral.
* Appearance: it also includes visual components like the character’s model, clothing, and equipment. You can modify how NPCs look, including changing their outfits or customizing their weapons.
