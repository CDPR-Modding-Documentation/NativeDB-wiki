## Use GitBook

This space is used to write and store documentation. It will synchronize the data in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CDPR-Modding-Documentation/NativeDB-wiki/). NativeDB get the documentation from this repository to show it when browsing the codebase.

{% hint style="info" %}
GitHub Api limits free access to 60 requests per hour. It doesn't require you to login with a GitHub account from NativeDB. It should be good enough for now.
{% endhint %}

If you never used GitBook before, you'll see that it is easy to use after learning some basics. [See this guide](https://app.gitbook.com/s/4gzcGtLrr90pVjAWVdTc/the-wiki) to learn you're way around.

NativeDB provides buttons to quickly open GitBook in the right place:

## NativeDB and GitBook

NativeDB expects a custom format and structure to get the data from GitBook, and to show it as beautifully as possible. You first need to learn a few rules, you can start with [this guide](structure.md). It will also explain some guidelines on what to write or not when documenting.

Now that you made a change request, wrote some documentation, you can request a review. An administrator will check it, and if it is alright, merge your change request.

Thank you for your contributions!
